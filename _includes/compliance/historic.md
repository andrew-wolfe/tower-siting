The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 is one of the federal environmental statutes implemented in the FCC's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) rules. Under the NHPA, federal agencies are required to consider the effects of federal undertakings on historic sites. Commission licensees and applicants must comply with NHPA procedures for proposed facilities that may affect sites that are listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. This process includes consultation with the relevant State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) or Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) to consider whether the proposed facility may create an adverse effect on an eligible or listed historic property.
