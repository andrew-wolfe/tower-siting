            <h3>Historic Preservation</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="span8">
            The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 is one of the federal environmental statutes implemented in the FCC's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) rules. Under the NHPA, federal agencies are required to consider the effects of federal undertakings on historic sites. Commission licensees and applicants must comply with NHPA procedures for proposed facilities that may affect sites that are listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. This process includes consultation with the relevant State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) or Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) to consider whether the proposed facility may create an adverse effect on an eligible or listed historic property.

            <h3>Environmental Compliance</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="span8">
            The National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) requires all Federal agencies to implement procedures to make environmental consideration a necessary part of an agency's decision-making process. As a licensing agency, the Commission complies with NEPA by requiring Commission licensees and applicants to review their proposed actions for environmental consequences. FCC rules implementing NEPA are found at Title 47 of the Code of Federal Regulations, Part 1, Subpart I, rule sections 1.1301 to 1.1319. If a licensee's proposed action falls within one of the categories listed in section 1.1307, section 1.1308(a) requires the licensee to consider the potential environmental effects from its construction of antenna facilities or structures, and disclose those effects in an environmental assessment (EA) which is filed with the Commission for review. The Commission solicits public comment on the EAs and assists its licensees in working with the appropriate local, state, and federal agencies to reach agreement on the mitigation of potential adverse effects. The filing of an EA is required when a proposed facility may have a significant impact on historic properties.

            <h3>Radio Frequency Safety</h3>
        </div>
        <div class="span8">
            The FCC is required by the National Environmental Policy Act of 1969 to evaluate the effects of RF emissions from FCC-regulated transmitters on the quality of the human environment. The Commission's RF emissions rules are designed to protect public health by limiting the maximum amount of RF emissions to which a licensee's facilities, in combination with other sources of RF emissions, may cause workers and the general public to be exposed. These rules are based on standards developed by the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers, Inc. and adopted by the American National Standards Institute, as well as guidelines recommended by the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements. The rules were coordinated with and are supported by federal agencies with health and safety responsibilities, including the Environmental Protection Agency, the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health, and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration. Last year, the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit affirmed the Commission's RF guidelines in Cellular Phone Taskforce v. FCC.

            The Commission's rules require owners of towers that meet certain height and location criteria (generally towers more than 60-96 meters (200 feet) in height or located near an airport) to register proposed towers with the FCC. The FCC's Antenna Structure Registration program allows the FCC to fulfill its statutory duty to require the painting and lighting of antenna structures that may pose a hazard to air navigation. Upon registration, and based on the recommendation of the Federal Aviation Administration, the FCC will require the structure to be painted and lighted as necessary to make it conspicuous to aircraft.
