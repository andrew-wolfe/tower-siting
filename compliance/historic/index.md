### The National Historic Preservation Act

The National Historic Preservation Act (NHPA) of 1966 is one of the federal environmental statutes implemented in the FCC's National Environmental Policy Act (NEPA) rules. Under the NHPA, federal agencies are required to consider the effects of federal undertakings on historic sites. Commission licensees and applicants must comply with NHPA procedures for proposed facilities that may affect sites that are listed or eligible for listing in the National Register of Historic Places. This process includes consultation with the relevant State Historic Preservation Officer (SHPO) or Tribal Historic Preservation Officer (THPO) to consider whether the proposed facility may create an adverse effect on an eligible or listed historic property.

#### NHPA Information

* The FCC released an order granting the application of Mid-Missouri Cellular to construct a tower that would affect a district listed on the National Register of Historic Places. This order clarifies licensees' responsibilities in complying with the National Historic Preservation Act - MO&O.

### Nationwide Programmatic Agreements

The Commission has entered into two Nationwide Programmatic Agreements (NPA) with the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) and the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers (NCSHPO) regarding the Section 106 process for new tower construction. The NPA also provides some guidance on collocation of communications equipment on existing tower structures. General or specific inquiries about the NPA can be submitted to the Commission at NPA Inquiries. Please leave a phone number with your query so the staff can discuss your question with you, if necessary.

### Collocation Programmatic Agreement

On March 16, 2001, the Commission, the National Conference of State Historic Preservation Officers, and the Advisory Council on Historic Preservation (ACHP) entered into a nationwide programmatic agreement to streamline procedures for review of antenna collocations. Under the programmatic agreement, most collocations on existing structures are exempted from the procedures set forth in the ACHP rules.

### Section 106

Required FCC Form 620 (new towers) and FCC Form 621 (collocations) are available on the FCC Forms Page. Applicants can submit these forms electronically at Section 106 Submissions. Public Notice DA 05-599 (pdf) provides procedures for submitting to the Commission determinations of no adverse effect when a SHPO has not responded within 30 days. Where the Form 620 or 621 was submitted electronically, these referrals may be made through the E-106 System. Otherwise, they may be made electronically at Section 106 Submissions or in hard copy to the Secretary's office.
